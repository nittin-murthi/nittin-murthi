## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nittin Murthi Dhekshinamoorthy and I am a Sophomore at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Engineering. I have a deep passion for the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and am constantly looking for opportunities to immerse myself whether it is through research projects, internships, project or courses. I am willing to get involved in any opportunity that will enable me to grow my passion and knowledge.

  I have currently completed coursework on Fundamental logic design, Circuit analysis, Embedded Systems and Assembly Language. I have also completed coursework on Assembly, C/C++ and all the way up until three-dimensional Calculus, Fundamental Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. Apart from my coursework, I am heavily involved in research and have extensive experience with machine learning frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch and Large Language Models such as Llama 3, GPT-4 and Mistral and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Hugginface and Langchain. You can check out my website https://nittin-murthi.github.io/PortfolioWebsite/ to learn more about me!
