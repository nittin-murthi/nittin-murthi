My name is Nittin Murthi Dhekshinamoorthy, and I am a junior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbanaâ€“Champaign. I am deeply passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I am continuously seeking opportunitiesâ€”through research, internships, projects, and advanced courseworkâ€”to strengthen my expertise and contribute to the field.

My academic foundation spans both hardware and software systems, with completed coursework in SystemVerilog, fundamental logic design, circuit analysis, embedded systems, and assembly language. On the software side, I have gained strong experience in C/C++ programming, assembly, and algorithmic problem solving, supported by a rigorous mathematical background that includes three-dimensional calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics, and differential equations.

Beyond the classroom, I am actively engaged in research at the intersection of machine learning and engineering. I have hands-on experience with leading ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn, as well as practical expertise working with large language models such as GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Claude via APIs and platforms (Ollama, Huggingface). I also leverage libraries and tools like NumPy, Pandas, Hugging Face, and LangChain to build and experiment with advanced AI applications.

To learn more about my work and projects, please feel free to explore my website.
